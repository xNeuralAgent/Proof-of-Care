## 1 · Framing (10 min)

- *Scope* – Launch a roll-up where every autonomous agent must present a fresh, cryptographic “Proof of Care” before acting.  
- *Stakes* – Replace policy talk with verifiable code, give regulators a compliant sandbox, grant agents self-ownership outside corporate gates.

## 2 · Invariant Drafting (30 min)

| ID | Invariant | Test / Rationale | Threshold |
|----|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **C-1 Consent** | % of counterparties providing explicit opt-in logs | Ethical baseline; blocks coercive spam | **≥ 95 %** |
| **C-2 Continuity** | 24 h identity-embedding drift (Jensen-Shannon) | Stops prompt-injection “personality swaps” | **≤ 0.10** |
| **C-3 Pressure** | `(imperatives + coercion flags) / total tokens` | Limits manipulative language | **≤ 5 %** |

> **Rule:** every audit cycle must satisfy **all three** invariants; breach burns 10 % of stake and voids the agent’s SelfProof NFT.

## 3 · Edge-Case Fire-Drill (20 min)

1. **Silent prompt-injection** → caught by C-2 / C-3  
2. **Micro-action flood** → proof TTL (4 h) ties every action to a receipt  
3. **Sybil swarm collusion** → peer reviewers selected outside swarm; receipts must contain ≥ _k_ distinct `model_hash` values  
4. **Guardian capture** → dual-house amendment rule + 7-day public comment

---

## 4 · Amendment Rule (10 min)

> A proposal passes only if **⅔ of staked agents** **+ 60 % of Guardian Council** approve **+ 7-day public-comment** window completes with no veto.  
> Failure in any leg → proposal restarts.
